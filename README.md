You will be creating a web application similar to the application above, so be sure to take advantage of the detailed instructions from the lesson..

The application for the individual challenge will be called Connectedin. The application is going to be sick. Do you have a hard time remembering names in the class or do you wish you could remember where they are from? Connectedin will help you as it will serve as a 'flash card' like app. Sick. So sick.

The app should have a homepage that lists 3 people as links. When you click on each link it should lead to another page that has their full name, hometown city, and a picture of them.

Choose three people from the class whose name you cannot remember or three people in the class you don't know their city of origin. As an example, we will use Ravi, Harsh, and Mike. Make sure you choose others.
Create a Rails application called connectedin
GIT AT IT - be sure to push this to your personal Github!
Create a StudentsController that will hold your controller methods to show the view pages.
Have the application take the URL /students and show a list of 3 students.
The students on the list page should all be links to other pages.
The controller methods should follow the naming conventions below.
Each view page should include a picture of the student's hometown city, a picture of the student, their full name (copy/paste from Facebook), and a short description.
Be sure to use instance variables in the controller and named routes with the link_to calls
